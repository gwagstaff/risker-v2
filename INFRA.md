## Core Services

### Game Server
- **Technology**: Python with custom asyncio or websocket implementations
- **Purpose**: Manages game state, processes player actions, and broadcasts updates
- **Scaling Strategy**: Horizontal scaling with game session sharding

### Database
- **Technology**: SQLite/Postgres for game state, Redis for real-time updates
- **Purpose**: Stores persistent game data, player profiles, and match history
- **Data Models**: Commander profiles, pawn profiles, game sessions, territories

### Matchmaking Service
- **Technology**: Dedicated python service
- **Purpose**: Pairs commanders with available pawns, manages game lobbies
- **Features**: Skill-based matching, role preferences, party grouping

### Web Client
- **Technology**: HTML5, WebGL/Canvas, Three.JS TypeScript (React or Vue.js)
- **Purpose**: User interface for both commander and pawn gameplay
- **Responsive Design**: Desktop and mobile support

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Networking Requirements
- UDP connections for real-time gameplay
- Websockets for non-real-time operations
- Latency optimization for battle gameplay

### Security Requirements
- Authentication system (OAuth, JWT)
- Cheat prevention mechanisms
- Rate limiting to prevent spam actions

## Use Cases to Support

### Commander Use Cases
1. **Game Creation**: Create new game sessions with customizable parameters
2. **Territory Management**: View, control, and deploy units to territories
3. **Resource Allocation**: Manage unit distribution and special abilities
4. **Battle Initiation**: Start battles and observe outcomes
5. **Alliance Formation**: Create and manage alliances with other commanders

### Pawn Use Cases
1. **Battle Join**: Find and join active battles
2. **Unit Control**: Control individual units during battle
3. **Ability Usage**: Deploy special abilities during combat
4. **Communication**: Coordinate with other pawns and commander
5. **Battle History**: Track personal performance and history

### Hybrid Use Cases
1. **Role Switching**: Players changing between commander and pawn roles
2. **Spectating**: Watching battles without participation
3. **Social Features**: Friends list, invitations, and messaging
4. **Tournament Play**: Structured competitive events

## Technical Challenges

### State Synchronization
- Real-time synchronization between multiple clients
- Handling network disconnections and reconnections
- Ensuring consistent game state across all players

### Scaling Battle Instances
- Dynamic creation and destruction of battle servers
- Balancing server load during peak times
- Handling variable player counts in battles

### Session Persistence
- Maintaining long-running grand board games
- Handling player absence during multi-day sessions
- Game state recovery after server outages
